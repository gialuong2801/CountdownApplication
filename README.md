## 1. Background
From high school students to business man, they all have deadlines for an important events. They are the final exam day or the deadlines of an officer. Moreover, some people want to know how many day to the festival.

So that we think it would be great if they could manage the time, for example, knowing how much time left. 

## 2. Vision and Goals

Our team want to build a software which can count how many day from present day to the day which is chosen by the user.
We will also add some Vietnam's festival days or important day of some special people (high school studen).

The simple process is: chose the day you want, name it( not require) then the software will display the number of day left. 

With the friendly interface, simple operation mechanism, this software will help the customer managing their time.
